*Making the Invisible Visible: Revolutionary 3D Physics Education*

---

## 🔬 **The Problem**
Electricity is **invisible**. Students struggle to understand circuits, current flow, and resistance because they can't see what's actually happening. Traditional education relies on abstract diagrams and theoretical explanations.

## ⚛️ **Our Solution**
**Circuitry** is the world's first platform that lets students **see electricity at the atomic level**. Watch electrons flow, encounter resistance, and interact with materials in real-time 3D visualization.

---

## 🌟 **Revolutionary Vision**

### What Students Will See:
- **Individual electrons** moving through conductors
- **Resistance interactions** as electrons scatter through materials
- **Energy conversion** from electrical to thermal energy
- **Semiconductor behavior** with electron-hole dynamics
- **Ohm's Law in action** with real particle physics

### The Impact:
*"For the first time in history, students can see why electricity works."*
